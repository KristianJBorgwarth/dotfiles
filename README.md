## Included Configurations

- **bspwm/**: Window manager configuration (`bspwmrc`)

- **polybar/**: Status bar configuration (`config.ini`, `launch.sh`)
- **ghostty/**: Terminal emulator configuration (`config`, `themes/`)
- **omp/**: Oh My Posh prompt themes
- **mods/**: Miscellaneous scripts or modules

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh2
   git clone https://github.com/KristianJBorgwarth/dotfiles.git
   ```

2. Copy or symlink the configs to your home directory as needed.
3. Install the required software:
   - bspwm
   - sxhkd
   - polybar
   - ghostty
   - oh-my-posh (for prompt themes)
4. Restart your session or reload the configs.
